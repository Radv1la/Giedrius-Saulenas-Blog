### Why cybersecurity?
Even though I am trying to put all my efforts into the domains of cybersecurity, I remain open minded. However, cybersecurity is an area that is really interesting for me. What fascinates me the most:
- You are always learning. Different technologies, different tools, different business domains. Cybersecurity is so broad that you face a lot of variety, which is a fuel for me.
- There is always a challenge. Even though cybersecurity might be an uphill fight, it is still fun trying.
- You get to hang around (either, virtually or physically) very smart people. I never liked being the smartest person in the room.
